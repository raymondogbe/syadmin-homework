# 1oT sysadmin homework

1) Add another HTTP endpoint that serves a file from an S3 bucket. Create the S3 bucket with Terraform. You can use the [provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket) directly or use `modules/terraform-aws-s3-bucket`.

2) Fill `private_subnets` variable with values given the VPC configuration above in the file. There should be three blocks.

There are two options for the 3rd task, choose one. 

1) Make the Localstack depend on [Docker-in-Docker](https://hub.docker.com/_/docker) container socket instead of the Docker running on your local machine.
2) Add an API that serves text content from DynamoDB table using Lambda.

Finally, commit (git) your work to the same repository and send it back via public repo link or email. Please add some documentation in MD format to accompany the changes in code.

## Prepare the environment

First, build Docker images locally and run detached

    docker-compose up --build --detach

Then, enter the worker container

    docker exec -it tfrunner-cnt bash -l

Verify that you have the necessary tools

    terraform --version
    aws --version

Go to the bind mount folder containing project files. Note that the files are always in sync between the host and the container.

    cd /mnt/terraform

Initialize the backend state file on S3

    terraform init -upgrade \
        -backend-config=endpoint="http://s3.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566" \
        -backend-config=access_key="myrootaccesskeyid" \
        -backend-config=secret_key="myrootsecretaccesskey" \
        -backend-config=bucket="1ot-platform-state-local" \
        -backend-config=key="tfstate.json" \
        -backend-config=region="eu-west-3" \
        -backend-config=skip_credentials_validation=true \
        -backend-config=skip_metadata_api_check=true \
        -backend-config=skip_region_validation=true \
        -backend-config=force_path_style=true

Create Terraform plan

    terraform plan -out .terraform/tf-plan.out
    
Apply the plan

    terraform apply ".terraform/tf-plan.out"

You should see an URL to test the ApiGW endpoint

    curl -X GET http://localstack:4566/restapis/d6ww3oe8ml/test/_user_request_/ -vv

And the API will reply `Cheers from AWS Lambda!!`.

Now you can proceed to the task.

## Additional info

There are two containers running in Compose:
- Localstack emulates the AWS endpoints. When you destroy the localstack container, all AWS resources are lost.
- tfrunner is an Ubuntu machine to contain the work environment, so you would only need Docker to run the project.
- Terraform state file is in `1ot-platform-state-local`. 
- You can also use awscli on tfrunner for testing, but the homework is designed so it wouldn't be necessary.

### Helpers

    docker-compose up -d --no-deps --build localstack # to build only the localstack

    terraform show # prints the current resources (from state)
